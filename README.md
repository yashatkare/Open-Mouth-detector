# Open-Mouth-detector
This script performs real-time mouth recognition using OpenCV. It detects mouths in a video stream from the default camera and applies visual markers on the edges of the detected mouth. It also applies a filter effect to differentiate when the mouth is opened wider than a specified threshold.
