Description:
This script performs real-time mouth recognition using OpenCV. It detects mouths in a video stream from the default camera and applies visual markers on the edges of the detected mouth. 
It also applies a filter effect to differentiate when the mouth is opened wider than a specified threshold.

Usage:

Make sure Python and OpenCV are installed.
Run the script using the command: python mouth_recognition.py.
A video window will open showing the live camera stream with mouth detection.
Requirements:

Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV 4.5.3 or compatible version (install via pip install opencv-python==4.5.3.56)
Instructions:

Adjust the frame_width and frame_height variables in the code to set the desired video frame size.
Customize the mouth_open_threshold value to change the threshold for detecting an open mouth.
Press 'q' to quit the script.
Notes:

The haarcascade_mouth.xml file is required for mouth detection. Please ensure that you have a valid Haar cascade XML file for mouth detection and update the code accordingly.
The accuracy of mouth detection may vary depending on factors such as lighting conditions and the quality of the input video stream.
